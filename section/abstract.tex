The project's aim is to expand the usability of existing Arduino devices, and simplifying the process of installing new functionality.
This report is an overview of the project of developing the system to do so, and how the work of the developer team evolved alongside the demands and needs of the customer.
The base idea was to create an easy-operable system running on Android based devices for installing compatible applications to the customers' existing Arduino device.
This was done by implementing the STK-500v1 protocol for AVR061 onto the Arduino Uno board, and creating a market-application for Android that handles connection via Bluetooth and data transfer over that protocol, as well as containing the market for browsing of available apps.\\
\\
The development of both the protocol and the app was done in Java, as both was designed to run on Android devices. This was a small challenge as the protocol originally was written in C for the AVR061.
