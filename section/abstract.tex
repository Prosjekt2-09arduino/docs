This report is an overview of the project of developing a system to deploy applications to Arduino devices.
The base idea was to create an easy-operable system for Android based devices for installing compatible applications to the customers' existing Arduino device.
This was done by implementing the STK-500v1 protocol for AVR61 onto the Arduino Uno board, and creating a market-application for Android that handles connection via Bluetooth and data transfer over that protocol, as well as containing the market for browsing of available apps.
