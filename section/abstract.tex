In cooperation with IDI at NTNU, SINTEF was the contracting customer for this project, hiring the group consisting of six students on the course IT2901.\\
\\
The project's aim was to expand the usability of existing Arduino devices, and simplify the process of installing new functionality.
This report is an overview of the project of developing the system to do so, and how the work of the developer team evolved alongside the demands and needs of the customer.
The base idea was to create an easily operable system running on Android based devices for installing compatible applications to the customers' existing Arduino device.
This was done by implementing the STK-500v1 protocol for communication with Arduino devices, and creating a market application for Android. This application handles connection via Bluetooth and data transfer over that protocol, as well as containing the market for browsing of available apps.\\
\newline
The development of both the protocol and the Andriod application was done in Java, as both were designed to run on Android devices. Implementing and integrating the protocol proved to be among the most time consuming tasks in the project.
