\section{Problem description}
The project task was to develop a platform for easy use, setup and sharing of Physical User Interfaces (PUIs) for Arduino$\texttrademark$. The task was divided in three main parts: a market application, over the air installation and example PUIs.\\
\newline
The purpose of the market application was to allow users of Arduino$\texttrademark$ to browse and download PUI applications for their Arduino$\texttrademark$ board on a mobile Android device. This market app was to be a simplified version of e.g. Google Play, where users easily can browse and install whatever applications they desire. An application selected for installation in the market application should be prepared on the mobile device, and installed over the air on an Arduino$\texttrademark$ board using Bluetooth$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ . The example PUIs were mostly intended to demonstrate the feasibility of the finished product.

\section{The goal}
The goal of the project task was to make Arduino$\texttrademark$ easier to use for ordinary people, by allowing easy browsing, sharing and installation of applications on Arduino$\texttrademark$ boards. By developing an application for over the air installation of applications, the finished product should ease the process of both installing and updating PUIs on an Arduino$\texttrademark$.


\section{Definitions}
This is a list of terms and abbreviations used throughout the project report in order to clarify and explain their meaning.

\begin{description}

\item[Android:]\hfill \\
An operating system for mobile devices based on the Linux operating system. It is developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance. Applications for Android devices are written in Java, and all the software is open source released under the Apache License.

\item[Apache:] \hfill \\
A software foundation focused on open source and community driven software.

\item[Arduino$\texttrademark$:]\hfill \\
A tool for making Physical User Interfaces (PUIs). It is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple microcontroller board.

\item[AVRDude:]\hfill \\
This is a tool to upload programs to microcontrollers from the Unix command line. This software has a lot of features, such as reading and writing to the microcontroller's memory over a serial connection. This software can also compile your C code into an Intel Hex file, a file full of binary information, that can be sent to the Arduino$\texttrademark$ with the STK500 protocol. Normally this is done with a cable between a computer and the microcontroller.

\item[STK500:]\hfill \\
This is a standard protocol used by many microcontrollers to upload and download memory, including the Arduino$\texttrademark$.

\item[PUI:]\hfill \\
An acronym for Physical User Interface. A PUI is a user interface which interacts with digital information through the physical environment.
