\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, together with use cases. At the end of the chapter the changes in requirements during the project will be described.
The requirements of the project will be kept high level and vague, to facilitate making choices as late as possible.
\section{Functional requirements}
	\begin{table}[H]
			\caption{Functional Requirements}
	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
		\textbf{FR01} & \textbf{Over the air installation}\\
 		& The Android application and the Arduino device should communicate over Bluetooth$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$  and install an arbitrary application from the Arduino Store in a simple two step process.\\
		\textbf{FR02} & \textbf{Easy to use interface}\\
 & The Arduino Store application should be easy to use and easy to understand. It should not be necessary to do anything on the Arduino except for starting it. On startup it should search for nearby Bluetooth$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$  connections with paired devices.\\
 		\textbf{FR03} & \textbf{Example PUIs}\\
 & To demonstrate the Arduino Store (on Android), over the air installation, and the application in action on an Arduino.\\
		\textbf{FR04} & \textbf{Validation of Arduino hardware and software}\\
 & The Android application should by default hide Arduino applications in the Arduino Store which are incompatible with the Arduino device depending on memory requirements and connected devices.\\
	\end{tabularx}
	\end{table}

\section{Non-functional requirements}
	\begin{table}[H]
		\caption{Non-functional requirements}
	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
		\textbf{NFR01} & \textbf{Usability}\\
		 & Both old and young persons should be able to understand how to use the application and install arduino-apps.\\
		\textbf{NFR02} & \textbf{Reliability}\\
		 & The application on the Arduino should work and start if rebooted.\\
		\textbf{NFR03} & \textbf{Open source}\\
		 & The project is under European R\&D project SOCIETIES. All source code will be open source under Apache 2.0 license.\\
		\textbf{NFR04} & \textbf{Platform compability}\\
		 & Arduino Store should be compatible in Android 2.3 and newer. See FR04 for compatibility for Arduinos.\\
		\textbf{NFR05} & \textbf{Extensibility}\\
		 & It should be easy to add features and extend this product later. The system should therefore be modular to simplify further development.\\

\section{Changes in requirements after midterm}
Approaching midterm it was discovered that the over the air transfer of PUI apps to an Arduino device proved to be more demanding than planned. After an extraordinary meeting with the customer it was decided to change the focus of the assignment. \\
\newline
The goal of the project remained consistent with previous statements. A prototype of the Android store application had been made, though not all functionality was implemented and tested. Further work on the Android application were temporarily put on halt. At this point the resources were primarily focused on implementing the STK500 protocol in Java to allow for programming of Arduino from an Android device. Se below for concrete additions and removals on the requirements.

% Add more as needed
\subsection{Additions}
\paragraph{STK500 protocol} As mentioned above, implementing the STK500 protocol proved more demanding than expected. Initial research done by the group on this area showed that an Java implementation of AVRDude already existed. Further research on the implementation, however, showed that it could not be used as it required programs not available on Android to be installed on the device. As of midterm, implementing the STK500 protocol in Java were added to the requirements.

\subsection{Removals}
\paragraph{$\mu$CSS server component} In agreement with the customer it was decided to remove the server side component of the assignment from the requirements. This was decided to pool resources to other more critical tasks.

\paragraph{Sync adapter} As the server component of the assignment was removed from the requirements, there was no need for the sync adapter.
