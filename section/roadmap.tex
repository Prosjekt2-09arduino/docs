\chapter{Roadmap for further development}
This chapter describes what work that remains in this project and a pointer to how this could be done.

%This is capitalized because its a name.
\section{The $\mu$C Software Store application}
This section goes into what further work that is necessary for the software store application.

	\subsection{Database}
	Synchronization with a remote database. Ubibazar's content provider and sync adapter could be used.

	\subsection{Standard for microcontrollers}
	Standardization for identifying microcontrollers. This is necessary to know which $\mu$C applications that is compatible with ``your'' microcontroller. This is documented in appendix C.

\section{STK500}
This section describes the further work of the protocol.

	\subsection{Hard reset}
	If something goes wrong during the installation over-the-air, the Arduino needs to be hard reset (back to its initial state).
	The group managed to hard reset the Arduino programmatically, but did not have time to implement it.

		\subsubsection{How to hard reset}
		This is how to hard reset an Arduino:
