\subsection{Development method}
Iterative model based on lean with proposal to the customer weekly. This agile methodology decreased the project risk and secured a complete and functional system for the customer. The customer could then influence our work and adjust potential misconceptions early in the project. Prototypes and demonstration for SINTEF was made in the beginning to validate our understanding of the requirements.\\
