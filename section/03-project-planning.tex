\subsection{Development method}
Iterative model based on lean with proposal to the customer weekly. This agile methodology decreased the project risk and secured a complete and functional system for the customer. The customer could then influence our work and adjust potential misconceptions early in the project. Prototypes and demonstration for SINTEF were made in the beginning to validate the understanding of the requirements.

\subsection{Team roles}
The group was organized in different roles based on skill and experience. Each team member was given a responsibility for some code-packages. Further, the team was divided in six subgroups where each subgroup had one responsible leader. These were respectively group leader, documentation and substitute leader, Android and GUI, arduino and PUI, over the air and test leader. The group worked in three subgroups of two, which made it easy to do pair-programming and individual work.

\subsubsection{Role evaluation}
The division of the group was an important feature. Every member knew who to contact about a specific problem, and who to contact regarding different tasks.\\

\begin{description}
	\item[Group leader]{was responsible the progress in the overall project. This person ensured progress and priorities for deadlines.}
	\item[Documentation and subsitute leader]{was responsible for management of documentation and reports. In absence of the group leader, this person took on the group leaders responsibilities. This person were also responsible for contact with the customer and supervisor.}
	\item[Android and GUI]{was responsible for the arduino part of the project. This implies contacting the arduino-lab, requirements of hardware and the coding part. This role were also responsible for development of the PUI examples.}
	\item[Arduino and PUI]{was responsible for the arduino part of the project. This implies contacting the arduino-lab, requirements of hardware, the coding part and over-the-air installation. This role were also responsible for development of the PUI examples.}
	\item[Over the air leader]{was responsible for programming the arduino over the air. This person was responsible for making the first prototype with a bluetooth connection.}
	\item[Test leader]{was responsible for developing and executing tests for the complete project.}

\subsection{Communication}
Most of the communication within the group was done at group meetings and when the group were working together. For communication between group members outside the meetings it was decided that the group should only use email and Skype. This was decided to avoid the confusion that might arise from using numerous channels of communication. Mobile phone was also used when immediate contact was necessary.\\
\newline
Communication between the group and the customer were mainly done in meetings or by email. The same applies for communication with the supervisor.

\subsection{Architectural scetch}
The market application is made for Android platform 2.2 or 2.3 and above. This depends on the the difficulties in creation of the application. It consist of a list of available apps for Arduinos and a requirement section to see what equipment and hardware that is required for each app.
