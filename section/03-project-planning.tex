\section{Development method}
%Iterative model based on lean with proposal to the customer weekly. This agile methodology decreased the project risk and secured a %complete and functional system for the customer. The customer could then influence our work and adjust potential misconceptions early %in the project. Prototypes and demonstration for SINTEF were made in the beginning to validate the understanding of the requirements.

Refined Unified Process (RUP) model is an extensible framework. By this we mean that it should be customized for a spesific project.
It is an iterative and incremental software development process that is divided into a series of timeboxed iterations.
Each iteration results in a increment, which is a release of the system that is an improvement of the previous iteration.
Most of the iterations will containt processwork as requirements, design, implementation and testing.

A feature of this model is that it is use case driven. Every iteration takes a set of use case scenarios from the requirements and use those for the content of the iteration.

The Unified Process model requires the team to focus on the critical risks of the project early in the development phase. This is especially in the Elaboration phase, where the greatest risks are addressed first.

The model consists of four phases:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Inception}
\item{Elaboration}
\item{Construction}
\item{Transition}
\end{itemize}

The Inception pase is the smalles phase and should contain the work of identifying risks and set the portion of requirements and use cases to work on in this iteration.

In the Elaboration phase the team is expected to filter out the majority of the system requirements and validate the system architecture.At the end of the Elaboration phase it should be created a plan and schedule estimates for the Construction phase. This will be the activity plan and the status report that is used in this project. 

The Construction phase is the largest phase where all the features is implemented into the system and the textual use cases is made.
\textbf{There was made an activity diagram at this point for every main module.}

The last phase: Transition phase, is where the system is deployed to the target users. Feedback might result in further refinements. This step could also include user training which was descided to not be done. This was because the system should be user friendly and easy to understand, and therefore redundant.

\section{Team roles}
The group was organized in different roles based on skill and experience. Each team member was given a responsibility for some code-packages. Further, the team was divided in six subgroups where each subgroup had one responsible leader. These were respectively group leader, documentation and substitute leader, Android and GUI, Ardunio$\texttrademark$ and PUI, over the air and test leader. The group worked in three subgroups of two, which made it easy to do pair-programming and individual work.

\subsection{Role evaluation}
The division of the group was an important feature. Every member knew who to contact about a specific problem, and who to contact regarding different tasks.\\

\begin{description}
	\item[Group leader]{was responsible the progress in the overall project. This person ensured progress and priorities for deadlines.}
	\item[Documentation and subsitute leader]{was responsible for management of documentation and reports. In absence of the group leader, this person took on the group leaders responsibilities. This person were also responsible for contact with the customer and supervisor.}
	\item[Android and GUI]{was responsible for the Ardunio$\texttrademark$ part of the project. This implies contacting the Ardunio$\texttrademark$-lab, requirements of hardware and the coding part. This role were also responsible for development of the PUI examples.}
	\item[Ardunio$\texttrademark$ and PUI]{was responsible for the Ardunio$\texttrademark$ part of the project. This implies contacting the Ardunio$\texttrademark$-lab, requirements of hardware, the coding part and over-the-air installation. This role were also responsible for development of the PUI examples.}
	\item[Over the air leader]{was responsible for programming the Ardunio$\texttrademark$ over the air. This person was responsible for making the first prototype with a Bluetooth$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$  connection.}
	\item[Test leader]{was responsible for developing and executing tests for the complete project.}

\section{Communication}
Most of the communication within the group was done at group meetings and when the group were working together. For communication between group members outside the meetings it was decided that the group should only use email and Skype. This was decided to avoid the confusion that might arise from using numerous channels of communication. Mobile phone was also used when immediate contact was necessary.\\
\newline
Communication between the group and the customer were mainly done in meetings or by email. The same applies for communication with the supervisor.
