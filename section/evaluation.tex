\chapter{Evalutation}

This chapter covers the evaluation of the final product, the process model and what the team learned in this course.

\section{Problems and Difficulties}
	First problem that the group met, was to not deal with incompatible licenses. This was quite hard because much is licensed as GPL 1 or 2 and are not compatible with Apache 2. \\

	The second problem was the decision to write the protocol or use a middleware on a computer.

	The last problem was to get the protocol to work.

\section{Interaction with the customer}
	The communication with the customer was great. A regular meeting was held every Friday, and the customer had an insight to the projects repositories, so the customer allways knew what was going on. 

\section{Usage of workhours}
	The group decided from the beginning that every member should work approximately 20 hours every week.
	In Table ~\ref{table:workhours} it is listed the total workhours for the group on every iteration.

	\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Iterations and time spent}
	\centering
	\label{table:workhours}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\hline
			{\bf Iteration} & {\bf Hours}\\
		\hline
			Iteration 1 (Week 6-7) & 186 hours\\
		\hline
			Iteration 2 (Week 8-9) & 257 hours\\
		\hline
			Iteration 3 (Week 10-11) & 233 hours\\
		\hline
			Iteration 4 (Week 12-13) & 129 hours\\
		\hline
			Iteration 5 (Week 14-15) & 195 hours\\
		\hline
			Iteration 6 (Week 16-17) & 220 hours\\
		\hline
			Iteration 7 (Week 18-19) & 263 hours\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	An associated chart diagram of the workhours are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:workhours}
