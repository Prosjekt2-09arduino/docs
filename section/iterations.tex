\chapter{Iterations}

This section contains an overview and a summary of each iteration of this project. The project was splitted into 
iterations of two weeks, and the content is based on the activity plan and the status report that was delivered to the supervisor.

\section{Iteration 1}
Week 6 and 7
\subsection{Summary}
	This was the first two weeks of the project and the group was getting together to know each others.
	Meeting with the customer to get the requirement spesification and understanding of the projects goal was done.
	Required libraries, licenses and other factors was taken in account before the group could start developing.  

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Confirm understanding of the task}
	\item{Ideas for identifying the capabilities of an Arduino device and how to communicate these to the store client}
	\item{Investigate potential solutions to faceilitate over the air installation of Arduino apps}
	\item{design the GUI for the app store}
	\item{Research on Apache licenses}
	\item{Meeting with customer}
\end{itemize}

\section{Iteration 2}
Week 8 and 9
\subsection{Summary}
	Nothing special happened these weeks. The group had a good progress and held a steady pace. The GUI design was drawed
	and the customers feedback on this design was good.

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Think architectural}
	\item{Designing of GUI}
	\item{Research on over the air implementation}
	\item{Research ubicollab libraries}
	\item{Use iJacket - generic app bluetooth connection code}
	\item{Implement a first sketch of the content provider}
	\item{Meeting with customer}
\end{itemize}

\section{Iteration 3}
Week 10 and 11
\subsection{Summary}
	Focus on bluetooth connection and over the air implementation was taken place these weeks. The application was taking form
	and the bugs was beginning to show up. There was some issues with over the air because of uncompatible licenses and much work was
	put on research. The Android application was estimated to be 50\% complete.

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Research ubicollab libraries}
	\item{Designing the rest of the GUI}
	\item{Establish a BT connection between android and arduino}
	\item{Implement last drawn of the content provider}
	\item{Meeting with customer}
\end{itemize}

\section{Iteration 4}
Week 12 and 13
\subsection{Summary}
	This iteration was critical when the implementation of over the air was said to be impossible with Apache v.2 License. 
	A crisis meeting with the customer was taken place and the group and the customer got in an agreement of writing
	a protocol (STK500) for installing over the air. Sync Adapter had to be eliminated and the focus was now on writing the protocol as a library.

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Crisis meeting with customer}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Not possible to develope over the air with apache v.2}
		\item{Come to an agreement of writing the protocol ourself as a library}
	\end{itemize}
	\item{Research on STK500}
	\item{Unit test sketches}
	\item{Develope android application}
\end{itemize}

\section{Iteration 5}
Week 14 and 15
\subsection{Summary}
	Good progress and much was done. The group was more optimistic about the protocol and the application was almost complete.
	The group was now splitted into two, where one group was writing the protocol, and the other group was writing Unit tests and polishing the last parts of the application.

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Added storage of hex-files to content provider}
	\item{Writing Robotium unit tests}
	\item{Writing the STK500 protocol in Java/Android}
	\item{Finishing the Android application except for the STK500 part}
	\item{Meeting with customer}
\end{itemize}

\section{Iteration 6}
Week 16 and 17
\subsection{Summary}
	This was the last two weeks of the project. The last parts of the application was complete and the STK500 was implemented into the application as a library.
	A workshop with the customer was done and an acceptance test and usability test was performed. Most of the time was spent on completing the documentation.

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Implement the STK500 to the Android application}
	\item{Workshop for SINTEF}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item{Demonstrate our finish application}
		\item{Acceptance testing}
		\item{Usability testing}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
