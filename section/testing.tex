\chapter{Testing}
	This chapter contains a description of the testing performed during the project. Tests were performed in order to ensure product quality and that the product met the requirements set.
	
	\section{Testing strategy}
		The ways in which testing was performed is detailed in this section. Testing was performed by unit testing first, then integration testing. Usability testing was performed after the main shop part of the project was completed. User acceptance testing was then performed by the customer after significant parts were complete.

		\subsection{Unit testing}
			For testing of the Android application, Robotium was used. Robotium is a powerful test framework that can be used for function, system and acceptance testing. The tests created in Robotium aims at writing small portions of code and checking the results against expected predefined values. Robotium was used for unit testing on the Android application. During the development of the application, different units were tested with Robotium after they were finished. An example of a Robotium test is shown below. In this test it is asserted that the Bluetooth connection with a Arduino device is as expected. \\

			\begin{lstlisting}
solo.clickOnActionBarItem(R.id.settings);

ConnectionState expectedState = BluetoothConnection
	.ConnectionState.STATE_CONNECTED;
	
ConnectionState actualState = BtArduinoService.getBtService()
	.getBluetoothConnection().getConnectionState();

assertEquals(expectedState, actualState);
			\end{lstlisting}

		\subsection{Integration testing}
		Integration testing is based on combining different units and testing the interface and communication between them. This type of testing comes after the unit testing phase and before the validation testing. The units that can be used in these tests must therefore have passed the unit tests. Because the system is composed of more than one component (STK500 protocol and the Android application), they were tested in pairs and not all at once. Integration testing identifies problems that occur when we combine the different units of the product, and was performed when units of the product was put together.

		\subsection{Usability test}
		As the intent of the product was to ease the use of and set up physical user interfaces, usability tests were crucial in the testing aspects. The decision were made to perform a hallway test following tasks given to the test subjects. To ensure that the test subjects had a proper understanding of the product, the think aloud protocol was used, meaning the subject talked about their actions during the test. \\
		\newline
		All test subjects filled out a System Usability Scale (SUS) form in order to create a score, 0-100, which gave us a comparable score with other systems. Concerning the amount of subjects tested, five users has been recognized as the proper amount. According to \cite{Nielsen}, 85\% of the problems with a system will be found by these five users, thus testing more would increase the time spent watching the same problems resurface.

		\subsubsection{Tasks}
			These were the tasks given to each tester. The tasks were created with the user cases previously mentioned as a basis. Each task is meant to be a vague description of what they are supposed to do in order for them having to think mostly for themselves and not given any answer as to what they are supposed to do.

			The preface of these tasks was that they had bought a jacket with an Arduino device fitted in it. This jacket was called an iJacket and they had just downloaded the $\mu$CSS in order for them to check what other applications they could have on this jacket.

			\vspace{6 mm}
			\begin{enumerate}
			 \item Select your jacket
			 \item Look for applications
			 \item Filtrate the applications which doesn't work on your jacket
			 \item Install the application
			\end{enumerate}
			\vspace{6 mm}

			After the tests the test subjects were asked if there were any details or points during the test where they either were confused or found it difficult to do something. These points would be added or confirmed on a form where the observer would have noted any other details which may have risen during the test.

		\subsection{User acceptance testing}
		User acceptance testing was performed with the customer in order to ensure that requirements were met and to check whether or not the customer was satisfied. This test was done in much the same way as the usability test, though with a scope bigger than just the usability aspect. A phone with the application was given to the customer in order for him to get first degree experience with the application. The tester was then asked to perform the same cases as in the usability tests, while thinking aloud in order to properly record his reactions to the application. These reactions were then written down on paper. After the cases were done with, the customer was given the opportunity to just play around with the product. Lastly, the customer was asked to what degree he felt the product fulfilled the requirements set for the product.\\
		\newline
		There were also expert reviews made during a presentation at the offices of SINTEF. The think aloud protocol was also used here. These testers had much experience within development, but not much knowledge about the task. They were therefore given a brief presentation beforehand about the project and given a short presentation of the application itself.\\


	\section{System Testing}
	\label{systemtesting}
	In this section the system tests will be presented. Each test was written to test a specific part of the product, and applies to both the Android application, STK500 protocol and software installed on the Arduino device. Each test was executed separately, and the results will be presented in section \ref{testresults}.

	\section{Test Results}
	\label{testresults}
		In this section the results of all the tests performed will be presented. In each subsection the result of the given type of test will be shown.

		\subsection{Unit Testing}
		All written Robotium tests run without encountering errors. This indicates that the units tested works properly and correct values are obtained throughout the testing. A decision was made to not write any more tests as time was of an essence and resources were needed elsewhere.

		\subsection{Integration Testing}
		When different units of the product was ready to be sown together, integration testing was performed. When bugs and errors was encountered, the person currently responsible for the integration testing would fix it. %Write more here?

		\subsection{System testing}
		The system testing was performed according to the description of the tests in section \ref{systemtesting}. In table~\ref{table:systemtestingtable} the results of each test is shown. These tests was performed when both unit testing an integration testing was done to ensure that the product met the requirements set by the customer.

		\subsection{Usability Testing}
		Usability testing has not yet been performed.

		\subsection{User Acceptance Testing}
		After the presentation by the customers request at the SINTEF offices, three people agreed to fill out SUS forms about their thoughts of the system. As there were still problems with the system, the scores were not too positive, but received an average score of 54 of a maximum of 100. The main ideas for improvements were stability and security. Stability was then worked on, but the security aspect was not recognized as an important focus point this late in the development. This was agreed upon by the customer after the meeting.

		\subsection{Summary}
		Based on the test performed during and after development of the product, table x describes to what degree the initial requirements set by the customer were met. As described in the table \ref{table:functionalsummary}, some of the requirements were omitted during the project as some tasks proved more time consuming than expected. As a result of this, not all the initial requirements have been met. \\
		\newline
		Regarding the non-functional requirements, it is difficult to summarize to what degree some of these requirements have been met. As a result of this not all the non-functional requirements is included in the table below.
