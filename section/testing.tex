\chapter{Testing}
	Testing is used to accomplish quality of the software and to avoid defects.
	
	\section{Testing strategy}
		\subsection{Unit testing}
			For the Android development an Android testing API (Robotium) was used.
			Robotium is a powerful test framework that could be used for function, system and acceptance testing.
			These tests aim at writing small portions of code and checking the results against expected results.
			For example the connection could be tested to check if it is consistent when we go into settings from the main activity.\\

			\begin{lstlisting}
solo.clickOnActionBarItem(R.id.settings);

ConnectionState expectedState = BluetoothConnection
	.ConnectionState.STATE_CONNECTED;
	
ConnectionState actualState = BtArduinoService.getBtService()
	.getBluetoothConnection().getConnectionState();

assertEquals(expectedState, actualState);
			\end{lstlisting}

			\subsubsection{Requirements tested this way}
			FR04 - Reliable bluetooth connection with the arduino\\
			FR05 - Hide/Show incompatible applications\\
			FR06 - Different ways to connect the Android to the Arduino\\

		\subsection{Integration testing}
			This test is based on combining different units and testing the interface between them. It is a phase after the unit testing and before the validation testing. The units that can be used in these tests must therefore have passed the unit tests.

			Because our system is composed in more than one process (stk500 protocol and the market application), they
			were tested in pairs and not all at once.

			Integration testing identifies problems that occur when we combine the units.

			A persistent bluetooth connection through the whole application was tested by checking if the service was providing a STATE\_CONNECTED at all times when we expected it to be connected. When the application was closed and reopened or if the phone was rebooted it should hold its state if possible (if the arduino was turned on and in range). 

			\subsubsection{Requirements tested this way}
			FR01 - Over the air installation
			FR03 - Example PUIs

		\subsection{Validation testing}
			Validation testing is used for validating that the system has met the customer's requirements. This was done by testing that the system is holding the requirement specification.


		\subsection{Usability test}
		As the intent of the product was to ease the use of and set up physical user interfaces, usability tests were be crucial in the testing aspects. The decision were made to perform a hallway test following tasks given to the test subjects. To ensure proper understanding of the test subject, the think aloud protocol was used, meaning the subject talked about their actions during the test. There were also expert reviews made during a presentation at the offices of SINTEF. The think aloud protocol was also used here.

		All test subjects filled out a System Usability Scale form in order to create a score, 0-100, which gave us a comparable score with other systems. Concerning the amount of subjects tested, five users has been recognised as the proper amount. According to \cite{Nielsen}, 85\% of the problems with a system will be found by these five users, thus testing more would increase the time spent watching the same problems resurface.

		\subsubsection{Tasks}
		These were the tasks given to each tester. The tasks were created with the user cases previously mentioned as a basis. Each task is meant to be a vague description of what they are supposed to do in order for them having to think mostly for themselves and not given any answer as to what they are supposed to do. 

		The preface of these tasks were that they had bought a jacket with an Arduino device fitted in it. This jacket was called an iJacket and they had just downloaded the $\mu$CSS in order for them to check what other applications they could have on this jacket.

		\begin{enumerate}
		 \item Select your jacket
		 \item Look for applications
		 \item Filtrate the applications which doesn't work on your jacket
		 \item Install the application
		\end{enumerate}

		After the tests the test subjects were asked if there were any details or points during the test where they either were confused or found it difficult to do something. These points would be added or confirmed on a form where the observer would have noted any other details which may have risen during the test.

			FR02 - Easy to use interface

	\section{Test Results}

		Table ~\ref{table:testresults} shows the test results of the Robotium Unit tests

		\begin{table}[ht!]
		\caption{Test Results}
		\label{table:testresults}
		\begin{tabularx}\linewidth{|m{0.15 \textwidth}|m{0.15 \textwidth}|X|}
			\hline
				{\bf Requirement code} & {\bf Result} & {\bf Comment}\\
			\hline
				FR01 & PENDING & This cannot be tested before the protocol is complete\\
			\hline
				FR02 & PASS & Usability testing was performed on SINTEF workshop\\
			\hline
				FR03 & PASS & \\
			\hline
				FR04 & PASS & This is possible unless you uninstall and install the application\\
			\hline
				FR05 & ERROR & There was no time to implement a standard for device compatibility validation\\
			\hline
				FR06 & PASS & The user can choose from a list a QR reader to use. The serialInput is a mac address\\
			\hline
		\end{tabularx}
		\end{table}

		\subsection{Unit Testing}
		All written Robotium tests run without encoutering errors. This indicates that the units tested works properly and correct values are obtained throughout the testing. A decision was made to not write any more tests as time was of an essence and resources were needed elsewhere.
