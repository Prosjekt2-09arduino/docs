\chapter{Testing}
	Testing is used to accomplish quality of the software and to avoid defects.
	
	\section{Testing strategy}
		\subsection{Unit testing}
			For the Android development an Android testing API (an extension of the JUnit API) was used.
			These tests aim at writing small portions of code and checking the results against expected results.

			In Android development, functions, contexts and Activities is a big portion of the coding.
			One small component is therefore one of these, and the unit testing is finished when these components are complete.

		\subsection{Integration testing}
			This test is based on combining different units and test the interface between them. It is a phase after the unit testing and before the validation testing. The units that can be used in these tests must therefore have passed the unit tests.

			Because our system is composed in more than one process (stk500 protocol and the market application), they
			were tested in pairs and not all at once.

			Integration testing identifies problems that occur when we combine the units.

		\subsection{Validation testing}
			Validation testing is used for validating that the system has met the customer's requirements.

	\section{Usability test}
		The customer required to test the product on average people.
