	Testing is used to accomplish quality of the software and to avoid defects.
	
	\section{Testing strategy}
		\subsection{Unit testing}
			For the Android developing it was used Android testing API that is and extension of the JUnit API.
			This test aim at writing small portions of code, and check the results against expected results.

			In Android development, functions, contexts and Activities is a big portion of the coding.
			One small component is therefore one of these, and the unit testing is finish when these components are complete.

		\subsection{Integration testing}
			This test is based on combining different units and test the interface between them. It is a phase after the unit testing and before the validation testing. The units that can be used in these tests must therefore have passed the unit tests.

			Because our system is composed in more than one process (stk500 protocol and the market application), they 
			was tested in pair and not all at once.

			Integration testing identifies problems that occurs when we combine the units.

		\subsection{Validation testing}
			Validation testing is used for validating that the system have met the customers requirements.

	\section{Usability test}
		The customer required to test the product on average people.
